# Projects
A list of projects I've worked on, mainly so I don't forget. Sometimes to remind myself Rome wasn't built in a day.

| ------- | ------ | --- | -------- | ----------- |
| [statuscode.app](https://statuscode.app/) | Active | $0 | 2023 - Current | A utility service for generating HTTP status codes. Itâ€™s useful for testing monitoring services. |

# Libraries
Other smaller items I've worked on that are valuable.

- [Deferred Request](https://github.com/armiiller/deferred_request) - A Ruby library for queuing requests to be processed later. Helpful when injesting large amounts of requests. Helps reduce the chance for DDoS.
