# Projects
A list of projects I've worked on, mainly so I don't forget. Sometimes to remind myself Rome wasn't built in a day.

# Libraries
Other smaller items I've worked on that are valuable.

- [Deferred Request](https://github.com/armiiller/deferred_request) - A Ruby library for queuing requests to be processed later. Helpful when injesting large amounts of requests. Helps reduce the chance for DDoS.
- [ms-rb](https://github.com/armiiller/ms-rb) - A Ruby port of the popular [`ms`](https://github.com/vercel/ms) library from Vercel. Convert human-friendly time strings like `"1h"`, `"2 days"`, `"3w"`, `"1.5mo"` into milliseconds — and convert milliseconds back .into strings.
